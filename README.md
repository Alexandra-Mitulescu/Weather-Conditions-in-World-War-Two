# Weather WW2 Dataset
The dataset provides information on weather conditions recorded during World War Two at various weather stations around the world.
It is a valuable resource for analyzing and studying weather patterns during that historical period.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes data on daily weather conditions such as precipitation, snowfall, temperatures, wind speed, and indicators of poor weather conditions like thunderstorms.
The information is recorded for different locations worldwide.

## Context
This dataset was initially explored in the context of analyzing the Aerial Bombing Operations of World War Two dataset. 
The historical significance of weather conditions during that time, including their impact on important events like the D-Day landings, led to the exploration of weather reports to compare with the bombing operations.

## Data Source and Acknowledgements
The weather data in this dataset is sourced from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information. 
The NOAA website provides access to a range of land-based station data, including datasets from the World War Two era.

## Models and Analysis
In addition to the dataset analysis, I have implemented various simple models and techniques. 
To improve the accuracy of the models, a grid search approach was utilized.
